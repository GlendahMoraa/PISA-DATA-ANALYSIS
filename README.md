## Dataset
The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), is a global study conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in member and non-member countries to assess educational systems by assessing 15-yearold school students academic performance in mathematics, science, and reading. This datasets contains information on their scores and other socioeconomic characteristics, information about their school and its infrastructure, as well as the countries that are taking part in the program.

Therefore, PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school.

The dataset contains the full set of responses from individual students, school principals and parents.The dataset includes background questionnaires, data files in ASCII format (from 2000 to 2012), codebooks, compendia and SAS™ and SPSS™ data files in order to process the data.

Around 510,000 students in 65 economies took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics and science representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally. Of those economies, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy.

Idividual identifiable infomation in the dataset include demographic and socioeconomic information about students (e.g., gender, birth month and year, parents’ occupation and education level) and also response to survey and test questions, and information about students’ performance on PISA


The PISA data can be useful in research on causal factors within or across education systems, in comparing education systems, institutional autonomy and admissions policies, and also allow typologies to be developed that can be used for comparative statistical analyses of education performance indicators, thereby identifying the consequences of different policy choices. They have also enable the generation of new  knowledge about education.

In this project, we are going to use Visualization to depict findings that will challenge deeply embedded educational practices in overal perfomance



## Summary of Findings

> It is noted OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries has the most number of student perfomance with `295416` student records which is about `60%` of the populationa where as the Non-OECd(Non-Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) has few of student perfomance with `190074` which is about `40%` of the population. 

> Female are slitely more than male by about `0.956` persentage. This explains that gender equality was observed in the process of collecting this data

> The Average Perfomance is nomarly distributed. Most of the Average perfomance estimates are alighned near the Mean which is the mean of around 500. The graph presents a unimodal distribution having  one pick

> 262631 of the students are given an estimate international grade of 10. This is like 54% of the total students. Fewer students are graded 13, 12 and 7 respectively.

> Its is obeserved that more than `3/4` of the student have access to more than `6 digital devices` devices at home. But the fact that about `1.7` don't have access of digital devices ilustrates that there is inequality in IT integration

> There is a huge inequality in ICT  integration in school. `317,214` student that is about `65%` 0f the population don't have access to ICT in there schools. `0.44%` enjoy the service of ICT integration while about `34%` compete for ICt resouces in schools

> `84.4%` of the students have fathers while `15.6%` don't have a fathers

> `94.0%` of the students have mothers while `6.0%` don't have a mothers

> `75.3%` of student have working Fathers, `11.0%` of the students there fathers work part-time, `4.8%` there fathers don't work and the `9.0` of the students there fathers either have do home duties or have retired

>`46.8%` of student have working Mothers, `16,7%` of the students there Mothers work part-time, `6.8%` there Mothers don't work and the `9.0` of the students there Mothers either do home duties or have retired

> `18.1%` of the students' mothers appear to have completed `ISCED level 3B`, `51.7%` complited  `ISCED level 3A`. A small percentage of `4.1%` did not complete `ISCED level 1`

> `20.6%` of the students' fathers appear to have completed `ISCED level 3B`, `48.6%` complited  `ISCED level 3A`. A small percentage of `3.7%` did not complete `ISCED level 1`

> It is disagreed that `151993` have a positive attitude towards school, `30700` students have a strongly agree and `74493` student have been awarded agree which as about `22.67%`

> About `37%` agree that teachers employ appropriate methods for classroom managament while about `17%` strongly. a small percentage of the population disagree and strongly disagree that the teacher employ approprate classroom management techniques

> There is a weak postive relationship bewtween the minutes a students reads per weak and the average perfomance

> Both gender are equal in terms perfomance, both have a mean of about `450`

> Students Who have a parent fairly perfom well. In both instances its clear that students who have either of the parent perfom better. But those who dont have a mother seem to perfom very poor than those who dont have a father

> A few `strongly agree and agree` that attitude towards achool does not affect student perfomance while a higher population `disagree and strongly disagree` that towards achool does not affect student perfomance 

> There is no signifiant relationship between Teacher classroom management and student average perfomance

> Student's average perfomance increase with the increase in level of education of parents. From the above graphs its seen that those students whose mothers and Fathers reached `Level 3A and 3` perfom better that who reached `Level 2, Level 1` and also students whose parents `Did not complete level 1` at all perfom poorly

> Availabilty of digital devices at home is seen to have an influece o students' overal perfomance, As shown in the first graph above at the number of devices increase there is an increase in average perfomance of the students

> On the other hand we is seen that with an increase in ICT tools there is a drop in average perfomance of the students

> Its observed that as the number ofdigital devices increase in the house hold, the in as increase in student perfomance as well as student's attitude toeards school

> Both Genders perform averagely between `250 to 650` and study between `0 to 500` hours minutes week.

> There is a week positive relationship between Minutes of reading in a week and Average Perfomance in both gendee

> For both male and female, those student who perfome well `disagree and strongly disagree` that attitude towards school does not contribute to student perfomance where as the ones who perform poorly `agree and strongly agree` that that attitude towards school does not contribute to student perfomance


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Most students are awarded international grade of 10
> There is Gender Equality in terms of access to education, perfomace.
> Students with parents perfom well
> There is inequality in terms of ICT integration in schools
> There is an increace in perfomance with an increase in access of digital devices and also this infuences postively the attitude towards school
> Attitude toward school affect student pwerfomance in both genders
> Parent level of education affect student perfomance
> Teacher classroom managemnet does not impact student perfomance
